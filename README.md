Monitor
========

Monitor is an easy to use framework for retrieving data, processing it and sending a message depending
on the result. 

There are three different submodules in this package, namely source, trigger and action. 
They provide the interface for the actual methods and a bunch of examples to enable the user to easily 
add own methods of said activities.
There are two classes 'stitching' those modules together, firstly monitor and secondly source_trigger_pair.
 For a closer documentation on them look at monitor.py

======================================

The main purpose of this module is not to give you an application for your specific problem, but to
provide a framework you can easily use to achieve your solution. 


Look at add_domain.rst for an easy introduction on to how you solve this problem.
