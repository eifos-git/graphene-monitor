monitor.source.peerplays\_balance module
========================================

Peerplays balance is one simple example of how this application could work with a blockchain. Two values have to be
defined in the config file:

::

    account_name: init0
    symbol: TEST

While account_name is pretty self explanatory, symbol needs to be provided to define what token is supposed to be
checked.
